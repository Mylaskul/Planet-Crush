# Planet-Crush

This Project was my entry for the Ludum Dare Game Jam 48. For people new to Ludum Dare, its a game jam where you get a topic and have 48h to complete a Game centering around it.

The topic this time was "Unconventional Weapon".

So I thought to myself, what is the most ridiculous weapon I can imagine. I quickly formed the idea of a game in which you have to protect earth from incoming planets...by throwing planets at them.

The game mechanics are are rather simple:

 - You play as earth
 - There are planets slowly moving towards earth
 - You control a gravity beam with can capture and release planets

The controles are:

 - left/right Arrow Key: rotate canon
 - up Arrow Key: shoot
 - R: restart
 - ESCAPE: go back to main menu

All graphics, music and code were done in these 48h with some brush-ups later on.
